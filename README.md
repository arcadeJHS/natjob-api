# natjob-api

This project borns to help a friend of mine: she was struggling to find a job. So the idea to experiment a little bit with [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), to have fun, and... sure, maybe to scrape through portals offering jobs to help her.

Based on [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.
